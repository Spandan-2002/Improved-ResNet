# Improved ResNet

This repository contains an implementation of an improved ResNet model for deep learning tasks. The model is designed to enhance the performance of standard ResNet architectures by incorporating modifications that improve accuracy and efficiency.

## Features
- Enhanced ResNet architecture for better feature extraction
- Optimized training pipeline
- Supports multiple datasets
- Includes visualization tools for model performance analysis

## Installation
Clone the repository and install the required dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Spandan-2002/Improved-ResNet.git
cd Improved-ResNet
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Run the training script:
```bash
python train.py --config config.yaml
```

Evaluate the model:
```bash
python evaluate.py --model_path path/to/model
```
